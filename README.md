Solutions to JavaScript code golf challenges, from The Programmer's Hangout

## Running

Most of these solutions are written to be executed on Repl.it, and sometimes exploit the properties of NodeJS's interactive REPL to output without calling `console.log`.

As a result, some of them will not reliably output unless their outputs are run in an interactive Node session.

The files can be executed reliably like this:

```
$ node
Welcome to Node.js
> .load 01_name_of_script.js
```
